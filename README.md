üë©‚Äçüíª Please fork this repo if you plan to create a project based on this version.

## General information
- Verified to work with Unity 2022.3.18f1.
- There is a readme for the components of the simulator: [`/Assets/CrowdSimulator/README.md`](https://github.com/KTH-High-Density-Crowd-Simulator/Crowd-Simulator-and-Tbana-Reconstruction/blob/main/Crowd%20Simulator%20and%20Tbana%20Reconstruction/Assets/CrowdSimulator/README.md).
- There is a template scene, which you can use as a basis for your own project, `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Scenes/Template.unity`
- There are sample scenes in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Scenes`.
- Prefabs needed for the simulation can be found in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Prefabs`.
- Please use the agent models in `/Assets/CrowdSimulator/Prefabs/Agents`.
- The models are (almost) scaled to match real life (1 unit in Unity = 1 meter).
- The subway reconstruction assets and scene can be found in `/Assets/Metroped`
